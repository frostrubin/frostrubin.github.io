## About
This page is a collection of various guides and hints that detail how to set up Linux booting on a Google Pixelbook.
I have not yet tested any of this, so far it is just a collection.

## Introduction
The Goal is to adapt the Pixelbook setup so that it can dual-boot Chrome OS ( in Developer Mode ) and Linux.
All data on the Pixelbook is wiped in the process.

## Needed Hardware
- Google Pixelbook
- USB Stick for Linux install Image (4GB to 8GB)
- USB Stick for Chrome OS Recovery Image (8GB)

## Preparations
You MUST prepare a USB Stick with a Chrome OS Recovery Image. If anything goes wrong during the installation/setup procedure, the device might end up 
without an OS to run. You don't want that.

- Install the [Chromebook Recovery Utility](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/chromebook-recovery-utili/pocpnlppkickgojjlmhdmidojbmbodfm)
and create a bootable Recovery USB Stick.
- Use the same utility to download the Linux distribution of your Choice. Rename downloaded .iso file to .bin to use it in the Recovery Utility.

## Developer Mode
